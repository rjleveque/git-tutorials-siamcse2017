# Version Control with Git

# Part I


### Tutorial for UW Applied Mathematics, 2020

#### Adapted from tutorial for the SIAM CSE Conference, 2017

http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=61491

### On Github: 

https://github.com/rjleveque/git-tutorials-siamcse2017

branch: `uwamath2020`

---

# .blue[What is git?]

 - Distributed version control (no central server needed)
 - Easy to take a snapshot of current state of all tracked files
 - Differences are efficiently stored
 - Easy to revert to earlier version, compare between versions
 
## .blue[Also facilitates collaboration:]

 - With yourself on multiple computers (and for backup)
 - With others (see Part 2)

---
   
## .blue[Documentation]

 - At the command line, try for example:  `git help commit`
 - [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/)
 - [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
   from https://education.github.com
 
### .blue[Tutorials]

Many exist on the web if you search, for example:

 - [From the Git Book](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
 - From Software Carpentry: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
 - UW eScience Institute:  
    - https://github.com/uwescience/git-novice
    - https://github.com/uwescience/git-intermediate

### .blue[Other useful tools]

 - [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) The git repository browser
 - [atom](https://atom.io/) Atom editor developed by Github
 - [git bash prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) Git information on your bash prompt
 
---
name: install

## .blue[Install git]

.red[Try this:]  At the command line,

```bash
    git config --list
```

If you don't have `git` installed, see for example:

 - [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the 
   [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/).
   
.red[Note:] This tutorial uses git from the command line.  <br>
On Mac OSX you also need Xcode command line tools installed.

Other GUI-based tools also exist.

---
template:install

### .red[Configure git:] (only need to do this once)

```bash
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    git config --global core.editor nano # or vim, emacs, etc.
```

See: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/


 
---
name: gitinit

# .blue[Turn any directory into a git repository:]

```bash
cd path/to/directory
git init
```

This creates a "hidden" directory `.git` containing the database.

---
template: gitinit

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Then use various commands to tell which files to track, <br>
take a new "snapshot", etc., e.g.

```bash
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "commit message"
```
<br>
(We will do this later)
---
name: clone-this-repo

# .blue[Or start by cloning an existing repository:]

For example, get these slides via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rjleveque/git-tutorials-siamcse2017

cd git-tutorials-siamcse2017
git checkout uwamath2020  # checks out a branch

ls -a  # list files, including those "hidden" to see .git
```

The clone contains all the history!

```bash
git log
```
prints all the commits and the commit messages, or:
```bash
git log --oneline   # gives one-line summary of each commit
```

---
template: clone-this-repo

### .red[Try this now.]

Then open `git-tutorials-siamcse2017/slides/part1.html`<br> 
if you want to view these slides in your browser.

???
To update:

```bash
git pull
```

---
# .blue[Git commit hash codes]

Every time you do a `git commit` you create a new snapshot of the state of all tracked files.

Each commit has a "name" that is a unique 40-character hexadecimal string.

#### .blue[Example:]

Scrolling through `git log` to the beginning shows the first 2 commits:

```bash
commit 6793f268b9b8c8b7151c7640291d4058a3061214
Author: Randy LeVeque <rjl@uw.edu>
Date:   Sun Jan 29 11:20:27 2017 -0800

    Added CC-BY license

commit 02eba6080c561fea283a5a39c24b000535f1b393
Author: Randy LeVeque <rjl@uw.edu>
Date:   Sun Jan 29 11:14:44 2017 -0800

    Initial commit with minimal README
```

The first 7 characters is usually enough to identify a commit, e.g. `02eba60`.
---
name: revert1

# .blue[Reverting to a previous version]

#### .red[Try this:]

```bash
    git checkout 02eba60
```

This restores the repository to the state after the first commit, when only one file `README.md` existed.  .red[(confirm this via `ls -a`)]

???
Discuss HEAD and detached HEAD

---
template: revert1

<br>
#### .blue[To get back to the most recent snapshot:]

```bash
    git checkout master
```

(We are on the `master` branch, more about branches later)

.red[Try this and confirm that all files are restored.]

???
Say something about "detached HEAD" message to lead into next slide

---
name:head

<img src="head_attached.png" width=600>

 - HEAD refers to the commit that is currently checked out

 - Usually at the tip of a branch

 - Otherwise HEAD is "detached"
 
---
template:head

<img src="head_detached.png" width=600>

See: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is

---

## .blue[Git diff] 

Compare files between two different snapshots, e.g.

```bash
    git diff --stat 02eba60 master          # show which files changed
    git diff 02eba60 master -- README.md    # show diff in particular file
```


If you have made changes to a file but not committed the changes, then you can see the difference in file from the snapshot HEAD via

```bash
    git diff README.md
```

## .blue[Git status]

Determine if there are changes in your working directory via

```bash
    git status
```
---

# .blue[Staging files for commit]

<img src="git-stage.png" width=600>

[Figure from https://git-scm.com/about/staging-area]




---

# .blue[Create a new repository]

Now let's try making a new repository.

.red[From here we will do a live demo, please follow along.]

For some instructions to do this on your own, see:

 - http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create/

 
---

# .blue[Some other useful commands]
 

```
    git ls-files`    # show which files are tracked by git
    git diff --cached   # diffs in files already staged
    git branch     # list branches
    
    git tag NAME  # create tag NAME
    git tag -l      # list tags
 
    git help
    git help diff
```

???

Switch to working through in a terminal window with a new repo


 - Illustrate `git init, git add, git commit`
 - Illustrate `git status, git diff`
 - Explain difference between untracked, clean, unstaged, staged
 - Illustrate checking out a single file
 - Reverting this file with a new commit
